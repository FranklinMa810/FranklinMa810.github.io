I am a curious quant who contribute 8 hours per day in:
* event-driven strategy (merger arb, index reconsititution)
* pricing and implied variable from it (e.g. vol surface, z-spread)
* portfolio construction
* execution and stochastic control

Current Projects
======
1. Option pricing for merger arb target company.     
This project is to deal with the problems:
* underlying change is not a normal distribution but a a combination of 2 normal distribution with one mean is around target price, another is around the price before merger announcement or even lower.
* the new implied vol surface by using this model
* how the vol surface change before and after merger announcement change - level, skewness($\frac{\partial \sigma }{\partial K}$), convexity
* how the change can explain the probability of deal success
* Case Study: Tiffany acquired by LVMH. LVMH mulls the deal success due to COVID-19 and riots on June 2 but officially confirmed to remain the pre-target price $135 at June 5.

2. Russell Index Reconsititution Prediction.
* Given unclear market cap calculation of index vendor, how to predict using public data.
* up or down?
* how long?
* Any other patterns? (e.g. significant for specific industry)
