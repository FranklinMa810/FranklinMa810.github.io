Inappropriateness of Basel Traffic Light in SIMM backtesting
=======
SIMM, Standard Initial Margin Model, is a industry-wide model for initial margin calculation. The model main purpose is to make initial margin as consistent number across industry. Also, from the purpose of initial margin, SIMM results should cover 99% 10-d PnL.    
To backtest this, the null hypothesis is, certainly, the probability that 10-d PnL is larger than SIMM is 1%, or more accurately, less than 1%.
